# HappyGreeny, your Plant Care Catalog 🌿🌼

## Overview

Welcome to HappyGreeny, a front-end project built by me with CSS and React. This application serves as a personal catalog for my personal indoor plants, helping you keep track of essential care activities such as watering, fertilizing, trimming, and repotting. Additionally, it will allow you (I'm currently working on it) to organize your plants based on their care level, light requirements, water needs, soil type, humidity preferences, and propagation methods.
